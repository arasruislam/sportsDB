He is currently signed to the American professional wrestling promotion WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Neville, previously wrestled in WWE's developmental territory NXT under the name Adrian Neville, and prior to that, competed on the independent scene under the ring name PAC. In NXT, he is one of three men to win the NXT Tag Team Championship twice, with his first reign being one-half of the inaugural champions with Oliver Grey and the other reign with Corey Graves. The other two men are The Revival's Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson. He is also a one-time NXT Champion, thus making him the first (and only) superstar to have held both the NXT Championship and the NXT Tag Team Championship.\r\n\r\nSatterley is noted for his high flying style, and his insane ariel attacks, which has earned him the nickname \"The Man That Gravity Forgot\". He began his wrestling career in North East England with a small promotion, the Independent Wrestling Federation (IWF), and after establishing himself in the United Kingdom with promotions such as Real Quality Wrestling and One Pro Wrestling, he began to perform overseas, most notably for the Italy-based Nu Wrestling Evolution, the United States-based Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG), Ring of Honor, Chikara, and the Japan-based Dragon Gate, where he has won the Open the Brave, Triangle and Twin Gate Championship in the latter promotion. He is a former PWG World Tag Team Champion, and winner of PWG's inaugural Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament (with Roderick Strong).",

Born in Brazil, he represented the Russia national team after being naturalised.\r\nHe started his professional career in 2005 with his hometown club Fortaleza, and signed for Swedish club Kalmar one year later. After two and a half seasons in AZ Alkmaar, he played in the Russian Premier League for Spartak Moscow, Krasnodar, and Lokomotiv Moscow.\r\nHaving joined Allsvenskan team Kalmar FF in spring 2006, Ari was the top scorer in the Allsvenskan 2006 with 15 goals, amassing one goal more than compatriot Afonso Alves had the previous season.\r\nOn 28 May 2007, Ari signed a five-year contract with AZ for an undisclosed fee. At Alkmaar he struggled to force his way into the first team on a regular basis, but he did win the 2008–09 Eredivisie.\r\nIn January 2010 Ari was transferred to Spartak Moscow for €3 million. Despite a successful career at the club, he departed amidst a conflict with management.\r\nOn 19 August 2013, he signed a three-year contract with FC Krasnodar. He left Krasnodar on 17 May 2021, after being a key player for eight seasons\r\nIn 2016, after Kosovo's membership in UEFA and FIFA, Ari was offered a chance to play for the Kosovo national team by their coach, Albert Bunjaki. Coincidentally, he was also an assistant coach at Kalmar, Ari's former club. The offer was rejected by the Football Federation of Kosovo's president, Fadil Vokrri.\r\nIn July 2017, Ari confirmed his desire to obtain Russian citizenship and represent the Russia national team at the 2018 World Cup. However, the citizenship process was delayed and he received a Russian passport in July 2018. On 12 November 2018, Ari was called up to the Russian squad for the first time for the friendly matches against Germany and Sweden.\r\nAs of now, Ari is one of three Brazilians who played for the Russian national team, the others being Guilherme Marinato and Mário Fernandes. He and Guilherme can speak Russian.\r\nAfter Ari was called up to the Russian national team, Pavel Pogrebnyak said: \"I don't see the point of this. I do not understand at all why Ari received a Russian passport. It is laughable when a black player represents the Russian national side\". Accused of racism, an investigation was subsequently launched, after which Pogrebnyak was fined and put on probation.",
